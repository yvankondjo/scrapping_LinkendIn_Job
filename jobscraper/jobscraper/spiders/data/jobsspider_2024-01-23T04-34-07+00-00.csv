Tu t’attendais à ce qu’on te parle d’études, de diplômes ou d’expérience, dans cette section ? Chez SFEIR, on n’a qu’un seul critère : c’est ton niveau technique et ta culture tech. On en reparle un peu plus bas ! 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♀️ Concrètement, quel sera mon job ?  On travaille avec une trentaine de clients. Ce sont des grandes entreprises du monde de la banque, assurance, industrie ou des startups/scaleups. En mission pour l’un d’entre eux ou sur notre Factory, sur des stacks récentes, tu conçois et développes des interfaces utilisateurs exceptionnelles. Chez nous, pas de TMA sur des technos anciennes… Mais plutôt sur des projets de transformation ou de build de nouveaux produits 😉 Au-delà de ta maîtrise de JavaScript et de son écosystème (ex : Angular, React, Vue.js, node.js, …) tu es quelqu'un de curieux(se) et dans le partage ! @Audrey , @Clément , @Samar & @Siham , nos super Account Managers, seront à ton écoute pour définir avec toi le projet idéal et tu pourras en changer lorsque tu en auras fait le tour. 🚀 Et si je souhaite évoluer ?  On se doute que tu veux te développer. Et on a réfléchi à ce qui pourrait te plaire. Une fois que tu as fait le tour de ton poste, voilà différents rôles que tu pourrais prendre chez SFEIR (mais ce n'est pas une obligation) : 🔹 Si tu veux rester 100% Tech : les  Staff Engineer  sont des référents techniques dans leur domaine et consacrent entre 1 et 4 jours par semaine à la communauté, en diffusant du savoir technique : formations, conseil aux managers, réponse aux appels d’offres avec l’équipe commerciale, … 🔹 Si tu veux t’orienter vers du Management : Les  Engineering Managers  sont les référents des Développeurs en mission. Tu serais leur coach pour les aider à se sentir bien dans leur job, les faire grandir et suivre leur carrière. Tu auras également la possibilité de prendre des casquettes supplémentaires en interne si tu le souhaites : 🔹 Tech Recruiter dans le processus de recrutement ; 🔹 Trainer aux SFEIR Schools ou au SFEIR Institute ; 🔹 Speaker lors de conférences, meetups, talks, auprès des écoles, … Et si tu as d'autres envies, on en discute. Chacun est différent et on fait au cas par cas. 💰 Combien tu vas gagner chez SFEIR ? Chez nous, pas de grille de salaire figée dans le marbre ! Cependant, il est important pour nous de garder une homogénéité entre les salarié(e)s en se basant sur les compétences et le marché actuel. On pourra t’en dire plus dès que tu auras passé notre process de recrutement technique, les PlayOffs, car les salaires que nous proposons ne prennent pas en compte ton âge, tes diplômes ou ton background. Tes compétences, rien que tes compétences ! En revanche, on peut te dire que, peu importe le salaire, un “Comité Carrière” annuel suit ton évolution et te permet de revoir ta rémunération chaque année. Tu bénéficieras également des avantages suivants : 🔹 Matériel mis à disposition : MacBook Pro ou Dell ; 🔹 Véhicule de fonction & carte carburant (pas obligatoire) ; 🔹 Assurance santé complémentaire ; 🔹 Carte restaurant Sodexo ; 🔹 Prime d’intéressement ; 🔹 Crédit formation de 2500 euros (tous les deux ans) pour te permettre de te former/certifier et d’assister aux meilleures conférences dans le monde ! 💻  Présentiel ou télétravail ? Les deux, mon capitaine ! On s’adapte à nos clients, mais la plupart sont en hybride. On se doit simplement de respecter la limite légale pour les frontaliers. 👋  “Je suis intéressé(e), comment vous rejoindre ?” Si cette annonce a attiré ton attention, il ne te reste plus qu'à postuler ! @Jonathan , @Philippe , @Julien ou @Justine se feront un plaisir de t'en dire plus. Tu pourras ensuite te frotter à nos célèbres PlayOffs : 3 tests d'évaluation technique en pair-programming (algorithmie, langage, framework). Tu trouves ça effrayant ? Pas de panique, nos évaluateur.trice.s sont bienveillants.e.s 😉 Ils te donneront aussi un aperçu de la culture d’entreprise et de la vie chez nous ! Tu pourras aussi discuter avec un commercial qui te présentera nos clients et projets, si tu le souhaites. Max 2 jours après les PlayOffs, on revient vers toi pour te débriefer, et : 🔹 Soit, on te dit sur quels aspects tu peux encore progresser et on te donne des billes pour que tu puisses retenter ta chance après un peu de pratique ; 🔹 Soit, on te fait une proposition d’embauche. Si tu as encore des questions, contacte-nous sur LinkedIn ! Et sinon, clique sur  Postuler  ✌️

We’re designing new factories, new equipment, new processes, and new software to rapidly scale battery manufacturing, globally. The primary bottleneck to Tesla’s future expansion (and the transition to sustainable transport and energy storage) is our ability to produce and procure batteries – that’s why we’re innovating in-house, with our collection of world-class engineers, to redefine the industry. Software, data, and automation all play a huge part in this strategy. We’ve built software from scratch with a nimble and high performing team to meet the specific needs of Tesla’s rapid battery manufacturing scale up. This software tracks every component of the cell manufacturing process and acts as the brain of the entire cell factory. It’s key to ensuring batteries are made safely and for understanding how to improve processes. This platform is the conduit for data coming from the line, and it is part of the goal to have more data about manufacturing, end to end, than any other company. The Cell Software team is responsible for building software solutions that allow the company to redefine manufacturing and production. We focus on implementing effective software advances, distributed fault-tolerant computing, and modern user- experience to manufacturing systems throughout Tesla. Our stack is built on top of Kubernetes, Kafka, React, Go, PostgreSQL and other related platforms. We are not stuck in legacy systems. We’re looking a developer to build new features for our Manufacturing Execution application, which interacts with PLCs and other equipment on the line (thousands of devices) to collect, analyze and direct manufacturing processes. You will be given direction about new requirements and features that need to be delivered, and then obtain the necessary information to build out solutions that directly solve Tesla business challenges. What You'll Do Solve world-first computing problems at scale that allow us to do more with our huge set of data  Write backend code that unlocks new features for engineers and associates across the manufacturing domain, and work with colleagues to integrate this code with our frontend  Write code that is reliable, well tested and which directly impacts Tesla’s bottom line  Interface with controls engineers, operators and other engineers to build the most effective automation systems and solutions. This includes getting immersed in defining and implementing automation system processes flows  Build tools, test-automation and documentation  Respond to and handle manufacturing process change requests promptly  What You'll Bring 1 + years of experience building backend systems  Exposure to systems that handle large data volumes and throughput  Understanding of algorithms, data structures, concurrency, distributed systems and eventual consistency  Proficiency in Go, Java, C, C++ C# or other backend language  Demonstrated experience building solid, testable, and maintainable clean code  Proficiency working in a high-impact, responsive, and collaborative team environment  Benefits Compensation and Benefits Along with competitive pay, as a full-time Tesla employee, you are eligible for the following benefits at day 1 of hire:  Aetna PPO and HSA plans > 2 medical plan options with $0 payroll deduction  Family-building, fertility, adoption and surrogacy benefits  Dental (including orthodontic coverage) and vision plans, both have options with a $0 paycheck contribution  Company Paid (Health Savings Account) HSA Contribution when enrolled in the High Deductible Aetna medical plan with HSA  Healthcare and Dependent Care Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA)  LGBTQ+ care concierge services  401(k) with employer match, Employee Stock Purchase Plans, and other financial benefits  Company paid Basic Life, AD&D, short-term and long-term disability insurance  Employee Assistance Program  Sick and Vacation time (Flex time for salary positions), and Paid Holidays  Back-up childcare and parenting support resources  Voluntary benefits to include: critical illness, hospital indemnity, accident insurance, theft & legal services, and pet insurance  Weight Loss and Tobacco Cessation Programs  Tesla Babies program  Commuter benefits  Employee discounts and perks program Expected Compensation $104,000 - $348,000/annual salary + cash and stock awards + benefits Pay offered may vary depending on multiple individualized factors, including market location, job-related knowledge, skills, and experience. The total compensation package for this position may also include other elements dependent on the position offered.

Et Luxembourg dans tout ça ?  SFEIR Luxembourg c'est :  🔹 Une centaine de développeur.euse.s qui se connaissent toutes et tous ; 🔹 2 Directeurs Engineering qui sont aussi des consultants @GuillaumeHomberg, @RenaudChardin ; 🔹 Une vingtaine de clients actifs en local et une centaine au niveau du groupe ; 🔹 Des événements en interne et externes organisés chaque mois (afterworks, webinars, meetup, formations) ; 🔹 Une communauté active : une cinquantaine de conférences externes données en 2022 (Voxxed Days, DevFest, Devoxx, communauté JS, …) ; 🔹 Des locaux situés à 2 pas de la gare centrale ; 💪 Ce qui fait notre force ? 🔹  Achieve greatness  - Notre culture est digital native.  L’agilité est au cœur de notre fonctionnement. On s’est inspirés des pratiques des entreprises Digital Natives pour construire notre succès : agilité, rapidité dans les prises de décision, organisation décentralisée, promotion et utilisation de l’Open Source, etc. 🔹  Proud to be developers  - Notre stratégie est co-construite, par les Techs pour les Techs. La direction générale et la direction de chaque agence sont co-leadées par 2 Managing Directors : Business & Engineering Individuellement, chaque développeur et développeuse reporte à un Engineering Manager. Ce dernier est lui-même développeur et a du temps dédié pour manager. Il travaille étroitement avec le Business pour proposer les missions les plus adaptées à chacun. 🔹  Learn & Share  - Notre communauté est apprenante et dans le partage. Nous sommes partenaires officiels de Google Cloud, AWS, Microsoft, Confluent, MongoDB, Linux Foundation, GitLab, SaFe, Snowflake, Looker, entre autres. On a nos propres dispositifs de formation (SFEIR Institute, SFEIR Schools, …). Ça nous permet de former officiellement nos clients et nos devs. Nous sommes présents à de nombreux évènements Techs au niveau national et régional : tu as sûrement croisé des Sfeiriennes et Sfeiriens si tu vas aux Meetups, aux DevFest ou aux Hackathons (Health et Industry Camp). 👩‍💻 👨‍💻 Qui sont les Sfeiriennes et les Sfeiriens ?  100% des développeur.euse.s sont des techs passionné.e.s par leur métier. Ce qui nous rassemble aussi, c’est notre envie de contribuer à la communauté et à l’entreprise. On a une hiérarchie très plate : on croit que l’entreprise est plus performante quand elle favorise l’autonomie et l’intelligence collective. Tu t’attendais à ce qu’on te parle d’études, de diplômes ou d’expérience, dans cette section ? Chez SFEIR, on n’a qu’un seul critère : c’est ton niveau technique et ta culture tech. On en reparle un peu plus bas ! 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♀️ Concrètement, quel sera mon job ?  On travaille avec une trentaine de clients. Ce sont des grandes entreprises du monde de la banque, assurance, industrie ou des startups/scaleups. En mission pour l’un d’entre eux ou sur notre Factory, sur des stacks récentes, tu conçois et développes des solutions logicielles en Java. Chez nous, pas de TMA en Java 8… Mais plutôt sur des projets de transformation ou de build de nouveaux produits 😉 Au-delà de ta maîtrise de Java et de son écosystème (ex : Spring, Quarkus …) tu es quelqu'un de curieux(se) et dans le partage ! @AudreyBazile, @ClémentHuaux, @SamarKhiari & @SihamRefaa, nos super Account Managers, seront à ton écoute pour définir avec toi le projet idéal et tu pourras en changer lorsque tu en auras fait le tour. 🚀 Et si je souhaite évoluer ?  On se doute que tu veux te développer. Et on a réfléchi à ce qui pourrait te plaire. Une fois que tu as fait le tour de ton poste, voilà différents rôles que tu pourrais prendre chez SFEIR (mais ce n'est pas une obligation) :  🔹 Si tu veux rester 100% Tech : les  Staff Engineer  sont des référents techniques dans leur domaine et consacrent entre 1 et 4 jours par semaine à la communauté, en diffusant du savoir technique : formations, conseil aux managers, réponse aux appels d’offres avec l’équipe commerciale, …   🔹 Si tu veux t’orienter vers du Management : Les  Engineering Managers  sont les référents des Développeurs en mission. Tu serais leur coach pour les aider à se sentir bien dans leur job, les faire grandir et suivre leur carrière.   Tu auras également la possibilité de prendre des casquettes supplémentaires en interne si tu le souhaites :  🔹 Tech Recruiter dans le processus de recrutement ; 🔹 Trainer aux SFEIR Schools ou au SFEIR Institute ; 🔹 Speaker lors de conférences, meetups, talks, auprès des écoles, … Et si tu as d'autres envies, on en discute. Chacun est différent et on fait au cas par cas. 💰 Combien tu vas gagner chez SFEIR ? Chez nous, pas de grille de salaire figée dans le marbre ! Cependant, il est important pour nous de garder une homogénéité entre les salarié(e)s en se basant sur les compétences et le marché actuel.  On pourra t’en dire plus dès que tu auras passé notre process de recrutement technique, les PlayOffs, car les salaires que nous proposons ne prennent pas en compte ton âge, tes diplômes ou ton background. Tes compétences, rien que tes compétences ! En revanche, on peut te dire que, peu importe le salaire, un “Comité Carrière” annuel suit ton évolution et te permet de revoir ta rémunération chaque année.  Tu bénéficieras également des avantages suivants :  🔹 Matériel mis à disposition : MacBook Pro ou Dell ; 🔹 Véhicule de fonction & carte carburant (pas obligatoire) ; 🔹 Assurance santé complémentaire ; 🔹 Carte restaurant Sodexo ; 🔹 Prime d’intéressement ; 🔹 Crédit formation de 2500 euros (tous les deux ans) pour te permettre de te former/certifier et d’assister aux meilleures conférences dans le monde !  💻 Présentiel ou télétravail ? Les deux, mon capitaine ! On s’adapte à nos clients, mais la plupart sont en hybride. On se doit simplement de respecter la limite légale pour les frontaliers. 👋 “Je suis intéressé(e), comment vous rejoindre ?” Si cette annonce a attiré ton attention, il ne te reste plus qu'à postuler !  @JonathanWolter, @PhilippeJourdan, @JulienPawlowski ou @JustineLelong se feront un plaisir de t'en dire plus. Tu pourras ensuite te frotter à nos célèbres PlayOffs : 3 tests d'évaluation technique en pair-programming (algorithmie, langage, framework).  Tu trouves ça effrayant ? Pas de panique, nos évaluateur.trice.s sont bienveillants.e.s 😉 Ils te donneront aussi un aperçu de la culture d’entreprise et de la vie chez nous ! Tu pourras aussi discuter avec un commercial qui te présentera nos clients et projets, si tu le souhaites.

It’s about you aligning with company values in a way that allows you to thrive personally and professionally. And it is about you tackling really hard challenges that lead to win-win outcomes for yourself, the company, and the customers we serve. Imagine impacting the world by building the solution to a HUGE business problem that no one has been able to solve. You’ll be collaborating with other A-players who are fully engaged in our mission to build a modern, ground-up build of our interviewing accuracy platform that augments the full sequence of interviews a candidate experiences. We have the ONLY interviewing tech who intervenes in an interview in real time to guide and correct the interviewer based on the conversation. MAKING YOUR IMPACT We released the MVP of our platform in September and have secured our first paying customers.

That's why people love us. We bring data tools with the elegance and simplicity of consumer products to the crufty world of enterprise business intelligence. We provide an opinionated open source starting point for how companies should measure, analyze and share their data, which is used by tens of thousands of companies. Metabase is looking for a customer-focused, highly technical Success Engineer to join our growing global team! We are looking for someone who loves data analytics, enjoys helping others, and is excited to work for a startup to help drive our Success Engineering team’s mission to help our customers be successful by guiding them on how to get data from all the various places it lives, transform it into useful shapes, or to convert their questions into actual queries that can be executed. You will help our customers design Metabase and everything around it to work best for their unique situations and troubleshooting issues as they occur. A typical day will involve a mix of: helping our users (one to one), writing up your solutions to help our entire user community (one to many) and helping us maintain our reference applications. Any given week, you might talk to our users to hear what they’re trying to accomplish, construct SQL queries to analyze data in Metabase, drop into a programming language to debug an embedding issue, or collaborate with our writing team. Why Success? We are the voice for our customers. Our product team reviews our feedback, asks us for advice, and engages with our customers proactively. We have a writer on our team who reviews what questions our customers are asking and improves our documentation, so the next customer doesn’t have to ask. We also work closely with an engineering team focused on critical issues and our escalations, so we don’t have to worry about our customers being impacted by major bugs for a long time. We’re 100% remote, and our operations are designed that way. People work during the times that work for them. You are not expected to be “on” at all times, and there are no points for responding quickly to every Slack you receive. We don’t overpromise our customers. Since we’re open source, our customers can see what we’re doing in our Github repository and our roadmap is publicly available for our customers at all times. Many companies use the word “success” to describe jobs that are really sales jobs or account management jobs with quotas. We are not about that. We’re exclusively here to make sure our open source users, our future customers who are currently on trials, and our current paying customers all get the appropriate help they need to be successful. If you want to take part and have a voice in a truly growing business, believe that BI analytics should be easy to use and set-up, and that self-service analytics should be a real thing and not just some marketing jargon that people put on their websites, please apply! Being a Success Engineer at Metabase would be a great fit for you if you: Enjoy helping people and solving their problems Have a strong technical background (minimum of 3 -5 years writing production code or administering systems) Have experience with using data visualization or data analytics tools (bonus if you have experience using Metabase) You are an expert in at least two of: Running Metabase on a variety of operating systems for multiple years Strong background in networking and how web applications function Managing servers (either physical, or Docker, or AWS/GCP/etc) Managing databases and strong SQL skills It’s not required, but a plus if you: Have experience with open-source products Are fluent in multiple languages (this is helpful as our users are world-wide) We're a global team (50% outside the US), fully distributed (from Thailand to California), who get things done asynchronously, with plenty of uninterrupted time, supporting each other to do the best work of our careers. We offer flexibility (define your own schedule and work from wherever you want), autonomy, and an environment that fosters growth, learning, and development.

SFEIR, c'est avant tout une communauté de 900 techs en France, en Belgique et au Luxembourg. Nous aidons nos clients à : 🔹 Être compatible avec le futur en développant leurs architectures SI, Cloud et Data ; 🔹 Donner de la valeur à leurs données, innover avec l'IA ; 🔹 Créer de la valeur grâce aux API & microservices; 🔹 Développer des applications web et mobiles pour améliorer leur expérience client et se connecter partout. Notre culture d'entreprise est résolument tournée vers l'expertise technologique, la transmission de connaissances et le respect de nos valeurs phares : bienveillance, inclusivité, excellence, liberté, responsabilité. Et Luxembourg dans tout ça ? SFEIR Luxembourg c'est :  🔹 Une centaine de développeur.euse.s qui se connaissent toutes et tous ; 🔹 2 Directeurs Engineering qui sont aussi des consultants @GuillaumeHomberg, @RenaudChardin ; 🔹 Une vingtaine de clients actifs en local et une centaine au niveau du groupe ; 🔹 Des événements en interne et externes organisés chaque mois (afterworks, webinars, meetup, formations) ; 🔹 Une communauté active : une cinquantaine de conférences externes données en 2022 (Voxxed Days, DevFest, Devoxx, communauté JS, …) ; 🔹 Des locaux situés à 2 pas de la gare centrale ; 💪 Ce qui fait notre force ? 🔹  Achieve greatness  - Notre culture est digital native.  L’agilité est au cœur de notre fonctionnement. On s’est inspirés des pratiques des entreprises Digital Natives pour construire notre succès : agilité, rapidité dans les prises de décision, organisation décentralisée, promotion et utilisation de l’Open Source, etc. 🔹  Proud to be developers  - Notre stratégie est co-construite, par les Techs pour les Techs. La direction générale et la direction de chaque agence sont co-leadées par 2 Managing Directors : Business & Engineering Individuellement, chaque développeur et développeuse reporte à un Engineering Manager. Ce dernier est lui-même développeur et a du temps dédié pour manager. Il travaille étroitement avec le Business pour proposer les missions les plus adaptées à chacun. 🔹  Learn & Share  - Notre communauté est apprenante et dans le partage. Nous sommes partenaires officiels de Google Cloud, AWS, Microsoft, Confluent, MongoDB, Linux Foundation, GitLab, SaFe, Snowflake, Looker, entre autres. On a nos propres dispositifs de formation (SFEIR Institute, SFEIR Schools, …). Ça nous permet de former officiellement nos clients et nos devs. Nous sommes présents à de nombreux évènements Techs au niveau national et régional : tu as sûrement croisé des Sfeiriennes et Sfeiriens si tu vas aux Meetups, aux DevFest ou aux Hackathons (Health et Industry Camp). 👩‍💻 👨‍💻 Qui sont les Sfeiriennes et les Sfeiriens ?  100% des développeur.euse.s sont des techs passionné.e.s par leur métier. Ce qui nous rassemble aussi, c’est notre envie de contribuer à la communauté et à l’entreprise. On a une hiérarchie très plate : on croit que l’entreprise est plus performante quand elle favorise l’autonomie et l’intelligence collective. Tu t’attendais à ce qu’on te parle d’études, de diplômes ou d’expérience, dans cette section ? Chez SFEIR, on n’a qu’un seul critère : c’est ton niveau technique et ta culture tech. On en reparle un peu plus bas ! 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♀️ Concrètement, quel sera mon job ?  On travaille avec une trentaine de clients. Ce sont des grandes entreprises du monde de la banque, assurance, industrie ou des startups/scaleups. En mission pour l’un d’entre eux ou sur notre Factory, sur des stacks récentes, tu conçois et développes des interfaces utilisateurs exceptionnelles. Chez nous, pas de TMA sur des technos anciennes… Mais plutôt sur des projets de transformation ou de build de nouveaux produits 😉 Au-delà de ta maîtrise de JavaScript et de son écosystème (ex : Angular, React, Vue.js, node.js, …) tu es quelqu'un de curieux(se) et dans le partage ! @AudreyBazile, @ClémentHuaux, @SamarKhiari & @SihamRefaa, nos super Account Managers, seront à ton écoute pour définir avec toi le projet idéal et tu pourras en changer lorsque tu en auras fait le tour. 🚀 Et si je souhaite évoluer ?  On se doute que tu veux te développer. Et on a réfléchi à ce qui pourrait te plaire. Une fois que tu as fait le tour de ton poste, voilà différents rôles que tu pourrais prendre chez SFEIR (mais ce n'est pas une obligation) : 🔹 Si tu veux rester 100% Tech : les  Staff Engineer  sont des référents techniques dans leur domaine et consacrent entre 1 et 4 jours par semaine à la communauté, en diffusant du savoir technique : formations, conseil aux managers, réponse aux appels d’offres avec l’équipe commerciale, … 🔹 Si tu veux t’orienter vers du Management : Les  Engineering Managers  sont les référents des Développeurs en mission. Tu serais leur coach pour les aider à se sentir bien dans leur job, les faire grandir et suivre leur carrière. Tu auras également la possibilité de prendre des casquettes supplémentaires en interne si tu le souhaites : 🔹 Tech Recruiter dans le processus de recrutement ; 🔹 Trainer aux SFEIR Schools ou au SFEIR Institute ; 🔹 Speaker lors de conférences, meetups, talks, auprès des écoles, … Et si tu as d'autres envies, on en discute. Chacun est différent et on fait au cas par cas. 💰 Combien tu vas gagner chez SFEIR ? Chez nous, pas de grille de salaire figée dans le marbre ! Cependant, il est important pour nous de garder une homogénéité entre les salarié(e)s en se basant sur les compétences et le marché actuel. On pourra t’en dire plus dès que tu auras passé notre process de recrutement technique, les PlayOffs, car les salaires que nous proposons ne prennent pas en compte ton âge, tes diplômes ou ton background. Tes compétences, rien que tes compétences ! En revanche, on peut te dire que, peu importe le salaire, un “Comité Carrière” annuel suit ton évolution et te permet de revoir ta rémunération chaque année. Tu bénéficieras également des avantages suivants : 🔹 Matériel mis à disposition : MacBook Pro ou Dell ; 🔹 Véhicule de fonction & carte carburant (pas obligatoire) ; 🔹 Assurance santé complémentaire ; 🔹 Carte restaurant Sodexo ; 🔹 Prime d’intéressement ; 🔹 Crédit formation de 2500 euros (tous les deux ans) pour te permettre de te former/certifier et d’assister aux meilleures conférences dans le monde ! 💻 Présentiel ou télétravail ? Les deux, mon capitaine ! On s’adapte à nos clients, mais la plupart sont en hybride. On se doit simplement de respecter la limite légale pour les frontaliers. 👋 “Je suis intéressé(e), comment vous rejoindre ?” Si cette annonce a attiré ton attention, il ne te reste plus qu'à postuler ! @JonathanWolter, @PhilippeJourdan, @JulienPawlowski ou @JustineLelong se feront un plaisir de t'en dire plus. Tu pourras ensuite te frotter à nos célèbres PlayOffs : 3 tests d'évaluation technique en pair-programming (algorithmie, langage, framework). Tu trouves ça effrayant ? Pas de panique, nos évaluateur.trice.s sont bienveillants.e.s 😉 Ils te donneront aussi un aperçu de la culture d’entreprise et de la vie chez nous ! Tu pourras aussi discuter avec un commercial qui te présentera nos clients et projets, si tu le souhaites. Max 2 jours après les PlayOffs, on revient vers toi pour te débriefer, et : 🔹 Soit, on te dit sur quels aspects tu peux encore progresser et on te donne des billes pour que tu puisses retenter ta chance après un peu de pratique ; 🔹 Soit, on te fait une proposition d’embauche. Si tu as encore des questions, contacte-nous sur LinkedIn ! Et sinon, clique sur  Postuler  ✌️

3800128700,Senior Biomedical Data Scientist,Myant,https://ca.linkedin.com/company/myantinc?trk=public_jobs_topcard-org-name,"Mississauga, Ontario, Canada",https://ca.linkedin.com/jobs/view/senior-biomedical-data-scientist-at-myant-3800128700?trk=public_jobs_topcard-title,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D0BAQFLBCihQWcSfA/company-logo_100_100/0/1631304214320?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=dy1aMEyuzcmHCaaSnznUBg0sMKblVm7nBHKdV-4eI7w,"About Us: At Myant, we are creating the world’s first expressive and continuous digital presence platform, enabled by integrating technology directly into clothing and augmented by other devices, wearables, and IOT. We see the evolution of society where every member gets to participate from anywhere and anytime through a whole-body experience, mostly in a passive or ambient manner to foster ubiquitous accessibility. Humans have a fundamental desire and need to be connected to our environment, family, community, and technology. This level of connection will create a paradigm shift in the way we deal with each other, especially from afar, allowing for more meaningful relationships, and more in-depth representation of ourselves. The need for this type of connection is not new. There are many companies working on ways to connect humans in singularity with technology, however most of these technologies are based on devices that are often used in episodical ways hence, leading to poor adoption or reliability. In general, innovation and technology have delivered significant benefits for many members of society. However, there are those who are left behind, namely the very young, the marginalized, the old and the sick. The challenge of inclusion for those left behind requires us to move beyond device focused strategies, towards an interface that we use naturally, every day. We believe that textile is that primary interface, used in clothing, coverings, carpeting and more, we wear and are surrounded by textiles universally, at all times. Such an interface could fuse data with other devices that we use periodically and data with other IoTs in the environment. People could then leverage their physical presence over their digital presence to communicate and share personal wellbeing. This could unlock healthcare that is proactive and preventative, social connectedness that is more profound, enable care distribution models to be seamless and on demand, better fitness insights, safer working environments and more. The vision for SKIIN -our first consumer-facing brand- is to enhance human ability through connected clothing and textiles. Skiin is in beta-phase market launch and has been recently granted Health Canada medical device license and submitted to FDA for regulatory approval in the US market. The sensors and actuators embedded within our apparel create your Digital Identity, which will be consumed by those who matter to you - your family members, physicians, trainers, other IoT devices - without you consciously having to think about it. The line between the digital and physical world is becoming increasingly blurry and we believe textile is the next medium to bridge that gap. We are a multi-disciplinary technology team solving big challenges at the intersection of electronics, deep tech., software, design, advanced manufacturing and data science. What we offer at Myant: Employee stock options Paid Sick Days and Floating Days Group Health Insurance Plan RRSP matching Plan Corporate Events Exposure working in one of the most innovative and forward-thinking tech company. Myant is a diversified, equal opportunity employer. People with disability or a special accommodation request may send an email to hr@myant.ca.

About Obelisk: Obelisk is the Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) lab at Astera. Obelisk’s mission is to produce AGI in a safe, socially beneficial way. We are focusing on different problems and different approaches than some other AGI efforts. In particular we are focused on the following problems: How does an agent continuously adapt to a changing environment and incorporate new information? In a complicated stochastic environment with sparse rewards, how does an agent associate rewards with the correct set of actions that led to those rewards? How does higher level planning arise? Our approaches to solving the problems are heavily inspired by cognitive science. To measure our progress, we are implementing reinforcement learning tasks where humans currently do much better than state-of-the-art AI. Your Mission: We are looking for a Machine Learning Research Scientist to join the Obelisk team. You will collaborate with engineers and other scientists to generate hypotheses, design experiments, and implement models and algorithms for making progress on the above-mentioned problems. Location: You will be required to be in the office in Berkeley at least 2 days per week because we find it significantly improves team cohesion and makes collaboration easier. Your Responsibilities Invent and implement new model architectures or learning algorithms for improving performance on tasks we care about Review relevant literature to find techniques we can build upon Guide the development of tasks that are useful for training and testing our systems Rigorously document your experiments Clearly communicate your results internally verbally and in writing Basic Qualifications PhD in a technical field, or practical experience which demonstrates similar technical expertise, independence, grit and creativity Preferred Qualifications Significant familiarity in some technical field outside of machine learning Experience training deep learning models to solve new problems Our tech stack We're building environments on top of Minetest, an open source game engine implemented in C++, with a Lua API for building games Our models are written using PyTorch (though we're open to using Jax) We have our own cluster of computers with Nvidia GPUs, managed by Kubernetes Related roles Machine Learning Research Engineer - more emphasis on running and optimizing experiments, requires less AI theory knowledge than this role Why work here? Plenty of funding and computers Trying to advance the state of the art in AI Smaller focus. Other places (e.g., DeepMind) are doing research into lots of problems simultaneously, or are doing research and building products (e.g. Anthropic). We are completely focused on a small set of problems Smaller team. This has benefits and disadvantages, but a huge advantage is less communication overhead and bureaucracy. This makes work faster and more fun No outside funding means there’s no pressure to chase trends or make products

Tu t’attendais à ce qu’on te parle d’études, de diplômes ou d’expérience, dans cette section ? Chez SFEIR, on n’a qu’un seul critère : c’est ton niveau technique et ta culture tech. On en reparle un peu plus bas ! 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♀️ Concrètement, quel sera mon job ?  On travaille avec une trentaine de clients.

En mission pour l’un d’entre eux ou sur notre Factory, sur des stacks récentes, tu conçois et développes des solutions logicielles en C#/.NET.

Tu serais leur coach pour les aider à se sentir bien dans leur job, les faire grandir et suivre leur carrière. Tu auras également la possibilité de prendre des casquettes supplémentaires en interne si tu le souhaites : 🔹 Tech Recruiter dans le processus de recrutement ; 🔹 Trainer aux SFEIR Schools ou au SFEIR Institute ; 🔹 Speaker lors de conférences, meetups, talks, auprès des écoles, … Et si tu as d'autres envies, on en discute. Chacun est différent et on fait au cas par cas. 💰 Combien tu vas gagner chez SFEIR ? Chez nous, pas de grille de salaire figée dans le marbre ! Cependant, il est important pour nous de garder une homogénéité entre les salarié(e)s en se basant sur les compétences et le marché actuel. On pourra t’en dire plus dès que tu auras passé notre process de recrutement technique, les PlayOffs, car les salaires que nous proposons ne prennent pas en compte ton âge, tes diplômes ou ton background. Tes compétences, rien que tes compétences ! En revanche, on peut te dire que, peu importe le salaire, un “Comité Carrière” annuel suit ton évolution et te permet de revoir ta rémunération chaque année. Tu bénéficieras également des avantages suivants : 🔹 Matériel mis à disposition : MacBook Pro ou Dell ; 🔹 Véhicule de fonction & carte carburant (pas obligatoire) ; 🔹 Assurance santé complémentaire ; 🔹 Carte restaurant Sodexo ; 🔹 Prime d’intéressement ; 🔹 Crédit formation de 2500 euros (tous les deux ans) pour te permettre de te former/certifier et d’assister aux meilleures conférences dans le monde ! 💻  Présentiel ou télétravail ? Les deux, mon capitaine ! On s’adapte à nos clients, mais la plupart sont en hybride. On se doit simplement de respecter la limite légale pour les frontaliers. 👋  “Je suis intéressé(e), comment vous rejoindre ?” Si cette annonce a attiré ton attention, il ne te reste plus qu'à postuler ! @Jonathan , @Philippe , @Julien ou @Justine se feront un plaisir de t'en dire plus. Tu pourras ensuite te frotter à nos célèbres PlayOffs : 3 tests d'évaluation technique en pair-programming (algorithmie, langage, framework). Tu trouves ça effrayant ? Pas de panique, nos évaluateur.trice.s sont bienveillants.e.s 😉 Ils te donneront aussi un aperçu de la culture d’entreprise et de la vie chez nous ! Tu pourras aussi discuter avec un commercial qui te présentera nos clients et projets, si tu le souhaites. Max 2 jours après les PlayOffs, on revient vers toi pour te débriefer, et : 🔹 Soit, on te dit sur quels aspects tu peux encore progresser et on te donne des billes pour que tu puisses retenter ta chance après un peu de pratique ; 🔹 Soit, on te fait une proposition d’embauche. Si tu as encore des questions, contacte-nous sur LinkedIn ! Et sinon, clique sur  Postuler  ✌️

Or in general, one buy-side firm to another? More exciting projects? The chance to build new systems? More scalability? A higher potential of bonus? What if we can offer all of the above and potentially more? Enough of the questions, here’s the real detail. You’re going to be coming into design and build various new systems for different teams across this quant Hedge Fund. Historically they’ve traded only equities but are currently expanding into other asset classes. It’s likely your initial projects will focus on building performant and scalable platforms for fixed income, specifically Government Bonds, Repos, Floating Rates, Interest Rate Swaps and more. What’s great here is that you’ll work closely with the users to ascertain what they need from the platform. There are no business analysts or product teams, meaning the feedback loop is small and you’ll see the immediate impact of what you do. You’ll work across the full stack using .NET, various JS frameworks and data streaming platforms. Typically, it’s a “best tool for the job” approach to development. This kind of “short feedback loop” approach is across the business. There’s a flat structure, with limited managers and some highly specialised individual contributors who offer plenty of advice. You’ll be able to take your career in any direction you like. The NYC office is small, with huge opportunities for growth in the future. In terms of your experience, you’ll need to come from a strong software development background at another financial firm, building software to support multiple asset classes. You will need to have strong development experience with C#, SQL and ideally various JavaScript frameworks. Experience with data streaming tools like Kafka, Spark or Flink would be a huge plus. This is a global, $50bn+ AUM Hedge Fund with a strong track record for successful returns. It’s stable and has grown continuously over the past 10 years and continues to do so across the world. Starting salary will be in the range of $150,000-$200,000 plus bonuses that could easily take your total compensation up to and beyond $500,000 if you’re a top performer. First year compensation will be made up of salary, sign-on bonus and a guaranteed bonus. Want to make your next move? Get in touch.

We see the evolution of society where every member gets to participate from anywhere and anytime through a whole-body experience, mostly in a passive or ambient manner to foster ubiquitous accessibility. Humans have a fundamental desire and need to be connected to our environment, family, community, and technology. This level of connection will create a paradigm shift in the way we deal with each other, especially from afar, allowing for more meaningful relationships, and more in-depth representation of ourselves. The need for this type of connection is not new. There are many companies working on ways to connect humans in singularity with technology, however most of these technologies are based on devices that are often used in episodical ways hence, leading to poor adoption or reliability. In general, innovation and technology have delivered significant benefits for many members of society. However, there are those who are left behind, namely the very young, the marginalized, the old and the sick. The challenge of inclusion for those left behind requires us to move beyond device focused strategies, towards an interface that we use naturally, every day. We believe that textile is that primary interface, used in clothing, coverings, carpeting and more, we wear and are surrounded by textiles universally, at all times. Such an interface could fuse data with other devices that we use periodically and data with other IoTs in the environment. People could then leverage their physical presence over their digital presence to communicate and share personal wellbeing. This could unlock healthcare that is proactive and preventative, social connectedness that is more profound, enable care distribution models to be seamless and on demand, better fitness insights, safer working environments and more. The vision for SKIIN -our first consumer-facing brand- is to enhance human ability through connected clothing and textiles. Skiin is in beta-phase market launch and has been recently granted Health Canada medical device license and submitted to FDA for regulatory approval in the US market. The sensors and actuators embedded within our apparel create your Digital Identity, which will be consumed by those who matter to you - your family members, physicians, trainers, other IoT devices - without you consciously having to think about it. The line between the digital and physical world is becoming increasingly blurry and we believe textile is the next medium to bridge that gap. We are a multi-disciplinary technology team solving big challenges at the intersection of electronics, deep tech., software, design, advanced manufacturing, and data science. What we offer at Myant: Employee stock options Paid Sick Days and Floating Days Group Health Insurance Plan RRSP matching Plan Corporate Events Exposure working in one of the most innovative and forward-thinking tech company. Myant is a diversified, equal opportunity employer. People with a disability or a special accommodation request may send an email to hr@myant.ca. Project Description: You will join a multidisciplinary team of researchers and engineers, to develop algorithms and signal processing techniques for analyzing various biosignals, and/or activity signals, and extracting information, events and trends, off-line and in real time. You will develop models to extract information from long-term individual-specific data. You will be engaged in solving problems that currently do not have well defined solutions and should take ownership of your deliveries, while supporting others in the team in their projects, in a fast-paced environment.. You will have to design protocols, collect and analyze data to validate the prediction capabilities of various metrics using Myant’s smart-textile based form factors. Responsibilities: Use tools and algorithms for data collection, testing and validation of our products for biosignal monitoring (e.g. sleep, activity, fatigue and stress). Clean and organize study data and assess quality and integrity of data collected. Visualize data statistics and perform exploratory data analysis to understand relevant feature engineering approaches.

Et Luxembourg dans tout ça ? SFEIR Luxembourg c'est :  🔹 Une centaine de développeur.euse.s qui se connaissent toutes et tous ; 🔹 2 Directeurs Engineering qui sont aussi des consultants @Guillaume , @Renaud ; 🔹 Une vingtaine de clients actifs en local et une centaine au niveau du groupe ; 🔹 Des événements en interne et externes organisés chaque mois (afterworks, webinars, meetup, formations) ; 🔹 Une communauté active : une cinquantaine de conférences externes données en 2022 (Voxxed Days, DevFest, Devoxx, communauté JS, …) ; 🔹 Des locaux situés à 2 pas de la gare centrale ; 💪  Ce qui fait notre force ? 🔹  Achieve greatness  - Notre culture est digital native.  L’agilité est au cœur de notre fonctionnement. On s’est inspirés des pratiques des entreprises Digital Natives pour construire notre succès : agilité, rapidité dans les prises de décision, organisation décentralisée, promotion et utilisation de l’Open Source, etc. 🔹  Proud to be developers  - Notre stratégie est co-construite, par les Techs pour les Techs. La direction générale et la direction de chaque agence sont co-leadées par 2 Managing Directors : Business & Engineering Individuellement, chaque développeur et développeuse reporte à un Engineering Manager. Ce dernier est lui-même développeur et a du temps dédié pour manager. Il travaille étroitement avec le Business pour proposer les missions les plus adaptées à chacun. 🔹  Learn & Share  - Notre communauté est apprenante et dans le partage. Nous sommes partenaires officiels de Google Cloud, AWS, Microsoft, Confluent, MongoDB, Linux Foundation, GitLab, SaFe, Snowflake, Looker, entre autres. On a nos propres dispositifs de formation (SFEIR Institute, SFEIR Schools, …). Ça nous permet de former officiellement nos clients et nos devs. Nous sommes présents à de nombreux évènements Techs au niveau national et régional : tu as sûrement croisé des Sfeiriennes et Sfeiriens si tu vas aux Meetups, aux DevFest ou aux Hackathons (Health et Industry Camp). 👩‍💻 👨‍💻 Qui sont les Sfeiriennes et les Sfeiriens ?  100% des développeur.euse.s sont des techs passionné.e.s par leur métier. Ce qui nous rassemble aussi, c’est notre envie de contribuer à la communauté et à l’entreprise. On a une hiérarchie très plate : on croit que l’entreprise est plus performante quand elle favorise l’autonomie et l’intelligence collective. Tu t’attendais à ce qu’on te parle d’études, de diplômes ou d’expérience, dans cette section ? Chez SFEIR, on n’a qu’un seul critère : c’est ton niveau technique et ta culture tech. On en reparle un peu plus bas ! 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♀️ Concrètement, quel sera mon job ?  On travaille avec une trentaine de clients. Ce sont des grandes entreprises du monde de la banque, assurance, industrie ou des startups/scaleups. En mission pour l’un d’entre eux ou sur notre Factory, sur des stacks récentes, tu conçois et développes des solutions pour répondre aux enjeux data. Au-delà de ta maîtrise de Python ou Scala et de l'écosystème Data (ex : Spark, Hadoop, Kafka, …) tu es quelqu'un de curieux(se) et dans le partage ! @Audrey , @Clément , @Samar & @Siham , nos super Account Managers, seront à ton écoute pour définir avec toi le projet idéal et tu pourras en changer lorsque tu en auras fait le tour. 🚀 Et si je souhaite évoluer ?  On se doute que tu veux te développer. Et on a réfléchi à ce qui pourrait te plaire. Une fois que tu as fait le tour de ton poste, voilà différents rôles que tu pourrais prendre chez SFEIR (mais ce n'est pas une obligation) : 🔹 Si tu veux rester 100% Tech : les  Staff Engineer  sont des référents techniques dans leur domaine et consacrent entre 1 et 4 jours par semaine à la communauté, en diffusant du savoir technique : formations, conseil aux managers, réponse aux appels d’offres avec l’équipe commerciale, … 🔹 Si tu veux t’orienter vers du Management : Les  Engineering Managers  sont les référents des Développeurs en mission. Tu serais leur coach pour les aider à se sentir bien dans leur job, les faire grandir et suivre leur carrière. Tu auras également la possibilité de prendre des casquettes supplémentaires en interne si tu le souhaites : 🔹 Tech Recruiter dans le processus de recrutement ; 🔹 Trainer aux SFEIR Schools ou au SFEIR Institute ; 🔹 Speaker lors de conférences, meetups, talks, auprès des écoles, … Et si tu as d'autres envies, on en discute. Chacun est différent et on fait au cas par cas. 💰 Combien tu vas gagner chez SFEIR ? Chez nous, pas de grille de salaire figée dans le marbre ! Cependant, il est important pour nous de garder une homogénéité entre les salarié(e)s en se basant sur les compétences et le marché actuel. On pourra t’en dire plus dès que tu auras passé notre process de recrutement technique, les PlayOffs, car les salaires que nous proposons ne prennent pas en compte ton âge, tes diplômes ou ton background. Tes compétences, rien que tes compétences ! En revanche, on peut te dire que, peu importe le salaire, un “Comité Carrière” annuel suit ton évolution et te permet de revoir ta rémunération chaque année. Tu bénéficieras également des avantages suivants : 🔹 Matériel mis à disposition : MacBook Pro ou Dell ; 🔹 Véhicule de fonction & carte carburant (pas obligatoire) ; 🔹 Assurance santé complémentaire ; 🔹 Carte restaurant Sodexo ; 🔹 Prime d’intéressement ; 🔹 Crédit formation de 2500 euros (tous les deux ans) pour te permettre de te former/certifier et d’assister aux meilleures conférences dans le monde ! 💻  Présentiel ou télétravail ? Les deux, mon capitaine ! On s’adapte à nos clients, mais la plupart sont en hybride. On se doit simplement de respecter la limite légale pour les frontaliers. 👋  “Je suis intéressé(e), comment vous rejoindre ?” Si cette annonce a attiré ton attention, il ne te reste plus qu'à postuler ! @Jonathan , @Philippe , @Julien ou @Justine se feront un plaisir de t'en dire plus. Tu pourras ensuite te frotter à nos célèbres PlayOffs : 3 tests d'évaluation technique en pair-programming (algorithmie, langage, framework). Tu trouves ça effrayant ? Pas de panique, nos évaluateur.trice.s sont bienveillants.e.s 😉 Ils te donneront aussi un aperçu de la culture d’entreprise et de la vie chez nous ! Tu pourras aussi discuter avec un commercial qui te présentera nos clients et projets, si tu le souhaites. Max 2 jours après les PlayOffs, on revient vers toi pour te débriefer, et : 🔹 Soit, on te dit sur quels aspects tu peux encore progresser et on te donne des billes pour que tu puisses retenter ta chance après un peu de pratique ; 🔹 Soit, on te fait une proposition d’embauche. Si tu as encore des questions, contacte-nous sur LinkedIn ! Et sinon, clique sur  Postuler  ✌️
